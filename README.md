# Final Project - Reading App

This is our awesome reading app. We used AngularJS, Bootstrap, Node and MongoDB to build this app. 
These were the requirements for this project with a few screen shots on how we implemented the requirements:

* One time screen scrape: http://thehundredbooks.com/.
    * See webscrape.js for how we did the screen scrape
* Show list of unread books with their progess by %.
* Show list of read books.

* When a book is selected, show book contents.
